# AUTO_MPG_Analysis

In this project we are using Auto MPG data set retrieve from UCI machine learning repository. This dataset was taken from the “StatLib” library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition. The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes. 
The mpg analysis has been around the corner of mind for every buyer, websites which analyse the cars performance, automakers, and data enthusiasts. The key idea behind the analysis is to figure out what are the parameters which are controlling the mpg of a car and see the relation between these parameters and mpg. The below experiment performs a regression analysis to find the answer to the above question. 

Conclusion: 

•	The p-values in lesser than the significant value for all the variables from the f-test and hence it conveys all the variables equally contribute to the model. The Miles Per Gallon is dependent on all the variables. 
•	The model did not suffer from larger residuals and the graphs concluded that the expected values and predicted values were almost the same. 
•	The overall data was able to explain the effect on MPG for example with the decrease in 0.5 acceleration the MPG increases by a certain number.
